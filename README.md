## 📋 Overview

The **Smart Document Classifier** is an advanced system designed for the intelligent categorization of textual documents, with a particular focus on Chinese text processing. It leverages sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including multi-level fuzzy string matching and domain-specific keyword extraction, to achieve high-precision document classification.

This system is engineered for both robustness and efficiency, suitable for academic research and enterprise-scale document management. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical NLP research and practical, high-performance applications.

### 🔬 Academic & Research Foundation

This project integrates principles from:
*   **Computational Linguistics**: For robust Chinese text segmentation and analysis.
*   **Information Retrieval**: Employing advanced string similarity metrics (e.g., Levenshtein distance, sequence matching).
*   **Machine Learning Classification**: Implementing multi-tiered matching strategies.
*   **Performance Engineering**: Utilizing parallel processing, efficient data structures (like Aho-Corasick), and caching mechanisms for scalability.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎯 Advanced Multi-Level Classification Engine
*   **Exact Matching** (High Precision): Direct string matching for known categories (e.g., "财务报表" → "财务").
*   **Intelligent Fuzzy Matching** (Robust Recall): Handles typos, synonyms, and partial matches using similarity scores and edit distances.
*   **Contextual Matching** (Semantic Awareness): Identifies categories based on surrounding keywords and phrases (e.g., "关于...的市场分析报告" → "市场").
*   **Confidence Scoring**: Each classification decision is accompanied by a dynamic confidence score, allowing for nuanced filtering.

### 🔍 Intelligent Keyword Extraction
*   **Geographic Name Filtering**: Automatically excludes common Chinese place names to prevent misclassification.
*   **Domain-Specific Stop Words**: Filters out irrelevant common words based on the document's likely domain.
*   **Positional Weighting**: Prioritizes keywords appearing earlier in the document.
*   **LRU Caching**: Optimizes performance for repeated text processing.

### ⚡ High Performance & Scalability
*   **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multi-core CPUs for significantly faster batch processing of large datasets.
*   **Memory Optimization**: Employs efficient data handling and caching strategies.
*   **Batch Operations**: Processes data in chunks to manage memory usage effectively for very large files.
*   **Real-time Progress Monitoring**: Provides visual feedback during processing.

### 🛡️ Developer & User-Friendly Design
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
*   **Graceful Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management with clear, actionable user feedback.
*   **Automatic File Handling**: Detects input files, creates backups, and manages file locks intelligently.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Clean, well-documented codebase (PEP8) for easy maintenance and extension.
*   **Beginner-Friendly Setup**: Clear instructions and default configurations get users started quickly.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Core Algorithm Example

```python
# Level 1: Exact Matching (Confidence ~0.95)
"人工智能项目报告" → "人工智能"

# Level 2: Fuzzy Matching (Confidence ~0.80)
"AI项目总结" → "人工智能" (via Sequence Similarity)

# Level 3: Contextual Matching (Confidence ~0.65)
"关于机器学习技术的研究方案" → "研发" (via keyword context)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
*   **OS**: Windows 10+, Ubuntu 18.04+, macOS 10.15+.
*   **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB+ recommended for large datasets).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TonyLu786/smart-document-classifier.git
    cd smart-document-classifier
    ```
2.  **(Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # OR
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Quick Usage

1.  **Prepare Your Data**: Place your Excel files (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) into the `input_files/` directory. The text to classify should be in the third column (Column C) of `Sheet1`.
2.  **Run the Classifier**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  **Check Results**: The processed Excel file will be updated with classification results and extracted keywords in the same directory.

### Excel File Format

*   **Sheet1**: Contains your data. The system reads text from **Column C (index 2)**.
*   **Sheet2** (Optional): Contains custom subject terms in **Column B (index 1)** for enhanced classification.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `config.py` file allows you to fine-tune the system's behavior.

```python
# Key Configuration Options
CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG = {
    'min_confidence_threshold': 0.8, # Minimum confidence to accept a classification
    'keyword_top_n': 3,              # Number of keywords to extract per document
    'cache_size': 20000              # Size of the LRU cache for keywords
}

PERFORMANCE_CONFIG = {
    'use_parallel': True,           # Enable multi-core processing
    'max_workers': os.cpu_count()-1 # Number of CPU cores to use
}
```
